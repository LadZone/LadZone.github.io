   <ul>
	<li>I recieved my 'Robot Arm' this morning. Although, I am ahead of scheduel, it would have been nicer to recieve my parts earlier. This would have given me even more extra time to spend on the build. The 'Robot Arm' arrived a bit late than expected because, I made an error in ordering it from the UK. 
    <li>So far, till now I have completed my PCB, and have recieved the last part to my build. My build video is comming to a near end, and sould be up by no later than Sunday.</li>  
	<li>I have not yet made any physical modification to the my arm, but have made some rough sketechs as to what I would like to make to reach certain size.</li>
	<li>I havent have had to buy any extra components or parts, however, I will if it helps me reach my goals quicker and in much more efficient manner.</li>
